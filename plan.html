  <h1> Project Plan</h1>
  <h1> Assignment 1 - CossiePlay </h1>
  <p>&lt; Michael Jizhar &amp; JC446564&gt; </p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p> The CossiePlay website is intended to increase publicity and revenue of CossiePlay company by exposing the services - increasing the quantity of costume made and party attendance. <br>
 <h2> Success Evaluation </h2>
<p>  Normal operations and other advertising will continue for the next 3 month period (without mentioning the new website). After 3 months period, CossiePlay will evaluate from the quantity of costumes made per week and people attending CossiePlay parties whether it will be higher than the current level of 4 costume per week and 30 people per month. CossiePlay will also evaluate whether there are changes to the demographic age-group of the people using CossiePlay service. Evaluation will take place after 3 months, so changes can be attributed to the new Website.
</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p> High School students and Young Adults - Generation-Y and Millenials Generation. </p>
<p> Current High School students and Young Adults are known to have a short attention span. So, titles, navigation bar and call to action should be clear and bold on the top to capture focus of audience. The design should be minimalist and trendy, not different color backgrounds per page, too many photos words or too many words per page, but to space out photos with white-space, so it is not clustered and stressful to read.
